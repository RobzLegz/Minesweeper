    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <div class = "instruction-container">
        <p>1. Pick the difficulty level and click on "Reset mines".</p>
        <p>2. On your first move click at any random place.</p>
        <p>3. The number on table field is the mines adjacent to the block.</p>
        <p>4. You will often come across a situation where you have to make a guess. (Usually this happens when the game is about to end)</p>
        <p>5. You can switch between modes "searching" and "flaging" by clicking on button next to "Reset mines".</p>
        <p>6. If you select flaging, you can mark spots, where you think the bomb is.</p>
        <p>7. You can win by finding all the cells that aren't bombs.</p>
        <p>8. You lose if you click on a cell that has a bomb (with searching mode on).</p>
